# Problem Statement
Being a data analyst at a marketing company, and the chief marketing officed told me that previous marketing campain have not been effective. So, I need to analyze the data to understand this problem and solve effectively.

# Brief
This idea was inpired from [this github repository](https://github.com/adiag321/CRM-Analysis-for-Marketing-data) with slightly modyfying the parameters and tried to analyzing different features in the dataset. Some of the work done is given below where we: 
1) Performed `Data Exploration` and `Segmentation` to study the key characteristic features of Potential customers using Python.
2) Executed `Hypothesis Testing`, `Statistical Analysis`, A`nomaly Detection` and `Trend Analysis`, and `Feature Engineering` to identify sequential demand patterns and Customer Behavior.
3) Calculated the top 10 Informative features using `Random Forest Feature` Importance.
4) Detected `Successful Marketing Channels` and `Underperforming Marketing Campaigns`.
5) Designed Interactive dashboards using Flourish to analyze the trends, give recommendations and publish the findings.
